# Hello MetaVerse!

One day soon, this GitHub account will feature repo of code written in my favorite languages, which include Groovy, Clojure, Coffeescript and Go.  Less preferred languages that I have varied expertise in include Java, Javascript, Python, C, C++, C#, PHP, Ruby, Pascal and of course,  Assembly Language.    I'm passionate about projects that tackle problems of meta-data management, graph data structures, security and application frameworks - and anything that improves the lives of engineers and end-users alike.

Regrettably, this corner of the internet is starkly bare and lacking in public content, as I'm generally very busy working with my current customers, who own the code that I write and that of most projects that I manage.    

Yours truly,
